# Statistical and Bioinformatic Workflow
### Bulseco et al., *In prep*
Code used in *Chronic exposure to nutrient enrichment lessens the effect of additional nitrate on organic matter decomposition despite changes to microbial community structure and activity* in collaboration with Anna E. Murphy, Anne E. Giblin, Jane Tucker, Jonathan Sanderman, and Jennifer L. Bowen

*Note*: The raw sequences for this project have been deposited to the SRA under archive TBD

Samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq located at UMass Boston (Boston, MA) using a 500-cycle V2 Sequencing kit in July and September of 2017. We followed protocols according to the Earth Microbiome http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/ and analyzed sequences using QIIME 2 (v2019.20).
