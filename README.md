# Statistical and Bioinformatic Workflow
### Bulseco et al., *In prep*
Code used in *Chronic exposure to nutrient enrichment lessens the effect of additional nitrate on organic matter decomposition despite changes to microbial community structure and activity* in collaboration with Anna E. Murphy, Anne E. Giblin, Jane Tucker, Jonathan Sanderman, and Jennifer L. Bowen

*Note*: The raw sequences for this project have been deposited to the SRA under archive TBD

### Table 1. Average (± SEM) characteristics of each study site prior to the start of the decomposition experiment. 

### Table 2. Average ± SEM  rates (nmol cm-3 hr-1) for of denitrification (DNF) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)

### Table 3. Average (± SEM) bulk density (BD), % organic matter (OM), % carbon, % nitrogen, molar C:N, % sulfur (N=4), and 16S rRNA gene copies per gram wet weight measured at the end of the decomposition experiment.
